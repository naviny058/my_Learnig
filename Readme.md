here i will upload all my learing and will continue to write this so today i solve 10 basic js question. those question are based on Dom and some js easy question 

```js
 function prevImg() {
            current = (current - 1 + imgs.length) % imgs.length
            updateImage()
        }

 function nextImg() {
            current = (current + 1) % imgs.length
            updateImage()
        }
```
as you can see this is a very cool way of incrementing to a variable and if the variable will end then it will start again and also for decrement. will use this readme as my personal diary
